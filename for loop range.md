# for loop

The for loop is slightly different in python. The programmer here can decide the number of times a block of code is to be looped around. 
Unlike other langauges such as Java, C++, there are no conditions in the for loop that are to be checked before executing the block. 

The range is an inbuilt function used to generate a sequence.
