# elif

In elif(else if), there is a hierarachy of if statements. First, the condition in the first if block is checked. 
If the condition turns out to be true, the block below gets executed and after the execution the control goes out of the elif blocks. The remaining elif blocks are not checked.
If the condition in the first block turns out to false, then next elif block is checked and so on.
