# while loop

In while loop, the condition gets checked first and the block within the while loop gets executed once. Then the condition is checked again and if found true, the block gets executed again
This goes on until the condition in loop becomes false. If condition would never become true, then the control would always be in the loop. This infinite loop has its uses as well.

# Syntax
while condition:\
-->statement

Here is simple program to print up to "n" numbers. At first, "iter" variable is assigned to 1 and then condition(iter<n) is checked for. If the condition is true, the while block gets
executed and iter variable is incremented by 1. Then, the condition is again checked and while block gets executed again. This goes on until the condition becomes False

An else block can be included with while block. The else block would get executed when the condition in while block is/becomes false. So, it is impossible for while block to get executed a finite number of times
